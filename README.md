# 💳 Pricing Plan UI – Mini Frontend Project

This is a simple and clean **Pricing Plan webpage** built using **HTML5** and **Bootstrap 5**. It displays three pricing cards (Free, Pro, Enterprise) and is fully responsive across all devices. The project was created as part of my frontend development practice during my MERN Stack learning journey.
